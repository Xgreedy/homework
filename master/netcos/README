Network Controller System
=========================
1, Pre-distribute the socket handlers between master
   node and slave nodes so that it would accelerate
   the time of sending packages.

2, According to the priority of sending jobs, they could
   get to a new balance after adjust the management algorithm.

3, The advantages of which the system is based on current
   H/W and S/W but not the realtime H/W and S/W are we
   could not require users to substitute their H/W and
   S/W with realtime ones sometimes (The condition may not
   be allowed).

Above three points are the nuts of this project.
